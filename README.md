# Atari-ST-draughts

![](screenshot.jpg)

Home made version of the game of international draughts for Atari ST.<br>
Also known as checkers in the US and 'dammen' in the Netherlands. <br>
The Dutch have a long tradition of draughts and had several world champions, 
such as Harm Wiersma and Jannes van der Wal.<br>
<br>
Coded in 1990 by my friend Marinus Jansen from the Netherlands. <br>
Developed on Atari ST in gcc. <br>
Tested in 2022 and still working.<br>
<br>
Play against the computer at arbitrary depth ('diepte') <br>
At full depth it was unbeatable for amateur players.<br>
This version supports 'crowning' (dutch: 'dam') <br>

<br>
It contains a simple GUI interface and mouse support.<br>
<br>
The project contains the following files :<br>
Dammen.c       - the C++ source code <br>
Dammen.prg     - the Atari ST executable<br>
